# Week 03: Data Warehouse and BigQuery

This week is dedicated to working with **Google BigQuery**, focusing on **data warehousing**, optimizing performance with **partitioning and clustering**, and exploring **machine learning** capabilities directly within BigQuery. We also cover deploying models with **Docker**.

---

## **Overview**

This week focused on building a strong foundation in **data warehousing** and leveraging **Google BigQuery** for analytical and machine learning tasks. Key highlights include:

- Understanding the architecture and role of **data warehouses** in managing large-scale data for analytics.
- Gaining hands-on experience with **BigQuery**, including working with SQL for querying, transforming, and managing datasets.
- Exploring **partitioning and clustering** techniques to optimize performance and reduce query costs.
- Implementing **BigQuery ML** for end-to-end machine learning workflows, from feature engineering and training to evaluation and prediction.
- Learning how to **deploy bigquery machine learning models** using Docker and TensorFlow Serving.

This week’s activities were entirely on **Google Cloud Platform**, emphasizing cloud-native tools for scalable and efficient data processing, except for the deployment, which was done locally using **Docker**.
