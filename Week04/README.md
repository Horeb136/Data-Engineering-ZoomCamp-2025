# **Week 4: Analytics Engineering**

This week focuses on transforming raw data into structured analytical views using **dbt (Data Build Tool)**. We cover **data modeling**, the **ELT workflow**, and **dbt fundamentals** like materialization, testing, and deployment. By the end of this week, Iâ€™ll have built and deployed a functional **dbt project**, preparing data for real-world analysis and visualization.

## **Prerequisites**

Before diving into Analytics Engineering, ensure that:
- You have a running data warehouse (**BigQuery** or **Postgres**) â€“ I am using **BigQuery**.
- Data ingestion pipelines are set up â€“ See [Week 2 Notes](https://www.notion.so/Week-2-Workflow-Orchestration-17129780dc4a80148debf61e6453fffe?pvs=21) on how to use **Kestra** for workflow orchestration.
- The following datasets are ingested:
  - **Yellow taxi data** (2019, 2020)
  - **Green taxi data** (2019, 2020)
  - **FHV data** (2019)
