# **Data Engineering ZoomCamp 2025**

Welcome to my repository for the **Data Engineering ZoomCamp 2025**! This course is a comprehensive, hands-on program designed to cover the entire data engineering lifecycle. Over the weeks, Iâ€™ll build an **end-to-end data pipeline** while mastering tools and techniques essential for modern data engineering.

---

## **Course Modules**
This repository contains my work, notes, and assignments for the following course modules:

1. **Module 1: Containerization and Infrastructure as Code**
   - Tools: Docker, Terraform, GCP.
   - Set up infrastructure for data engineering pipelines.
2. **Module 2: Workflow Orchestration**
   - Tools: Kestra, Prefect, Airflow (optional).
   - Build workflows for scalable pipelines.
3. **Module 3: Data Warehouse**
   - Learn BigQuery and data warehousing concepts.
   - Optimize queries with partitioning and clustering.
4. **Module 4: Analytics Engineering** 
   - Tools: dbt (Data Build Tool), BigQuery, Looker Studio.
   - Transform raw data into analytical models.
5. **Module 5: Batch Processing** 
   - Explore Spark for large-scale data processing.
6. **Module 6: Streaming** 
   - Dive into real-time data streaming with Kafka.
